[Clementine](https://github.com/clementine-player/Clementine) is a music player and library organizer made with Qt.  
I helped refactor away from deprecated Qt5 functions.  
Made sorting in playlist ignore "The" or any other configurable prefixes, which is a more natural way to order on album/artist names
