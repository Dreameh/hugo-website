[KDevelop](https://kdevelop.org) is a cross-platform IDE that I primarily use for all my C++ IDE needs.  
I try to add/fix things when I can.  
Some notable contributions:  
Scratchpad plugin. A plugin that helps you keep a list of "scratches",
temporary code files that don't belong to a project that you can run.
Helps you experiment with code, or run small programs that don't need a full project/build system.  
Assistant to automatically generate header guard if they're missing in header files
