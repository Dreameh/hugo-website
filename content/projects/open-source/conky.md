[Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) let's you display system information on your desektop using a configuration file.
You can set different colors and fonts for the content, however setting the font involved repeating the font settings inline for each block of text that required it!
I made a patch to allow creating font *variables* where you pre-define the settings and then conveniently reuse them.
